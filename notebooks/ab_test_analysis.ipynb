    "The product team is considering rolling out a new feature aimed at improving user engagement and conversion. The feature simplifies the onboarding flow by reducing the number of required steps for new users. Before making a launch decision, it is necessary to evaluate whether the feature has a statistically and practically meaningful impact on key business metrics.\n",

    "An A/B experiment is conducted to compare user behavior between a control group (existing product experience) and a treatment group (new feature enabled). The goal of the analysis is not only to assess statistical significance, but also to interpret the results from a business perspective and provide a clear product recommendation. The analysis focuses on decision-making under uncertainty, trade-offs between statistical rigor and business impact, and realistic constraints commonly faced in product experiments.\n"
