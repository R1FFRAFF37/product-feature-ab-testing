The goal of the analysis is not only to assess statistical significance, but also to interpret the results from a business perspective and provide a clear product recommendation. The analysis focuses on decision-making under uncertainty, trade-offs between statistical rigor and business impact, and realistic constraints commonly faced in product experiments.\n"
